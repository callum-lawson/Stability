The R-script grind.R is a wrapper around the deSolve, rootSolve and FME
R-libraries making it very easy to perform phase plane analysis and fit
ODE models to data.

Make sure that the libraries deSolve, rootSolve and FME are installed,
source the grind.R script and then run any of the models provided here.

The tutorial.pdf file provides a full manual.

Also check the Lotka Volterra model on the interactive webpage

Enjoy
