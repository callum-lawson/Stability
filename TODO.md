# TODO
To-do list. 

## Organise
* See if weaker DD exaggerates non-linear climate effects when DD is nonlinear (how to define "weaker" here?)
* See how climate variability affects average population size when climate effects are *linear* but DD effects are nonlinear.
* Generalise simulation functions to accept arbitrary parameters and r functions
